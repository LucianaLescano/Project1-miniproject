## Hangman 💀
### THE game
    This a version of the classic of classics: THE HANGMAN! You only have to guess a word before you end up DEAD! How can you guess? A good first step is by typying a letter you think the word has. Fail, and see the gallow and your own body appear in front of your very own SCREEN little by little! 😰
### Instructions
    1. You'll see how the game starts with a nice greeting.
    2. Also, you'll see a hint because I'm not gonna put all the Oxford Dictionary into this. 😂
    3. Type the letter you think the word is gonna have.
    4. Fail and you'll see how the gallow starts to appear... 
    5. Guess right, and the game will tell you. I'm a nice coder. 🥳
    6. You have 6 guess until you end up DEAAAD! And the game will tell you that, rest assure. 🤓
    7. If you think you know the word, just type it! The game would tell you if you're right.
    8. You cannot play another round as I'm unable to close the while loop. 🙄
### MY code
    Here comes the serious part...
    - First of all a nice message for all the users.
    - My list of possible words is in other file named "my dictionary", even when I think this is not neccesary (don't get mand) it is just because I only have a few words, but girl I must test my ability to import files. 
    - Import random so a random word is choosen. 
    - Then you'll see all the possible stages of the gallow, from alive to dead. My ability to draw with lines was strongly increased.
    - Last but NOT least, my unstoppable while loop:
        * It ask the user for a word, using our favorite function "input".
        * A global "if" condition to tell the game to stop if the user kill our poor friend.
        * The first three conditionals only make sure the user is not cheating, this will only accept a word which length is one and belong to the alphabet.
        Inside this loop you'll see another three conditonals, the first one it is just to make sure the letter is not repeated; the second one just to check and show a message if the user fails and the last check and show a message if the user guess.
        * Second conditionals only make sure the user is not cheating, this will only accept a word which length is same as the word to guess and all its characters belong to the alphabet.
        Inside this loop you'll see another three conditonals, the first one it is just to make sure the word is not repeated; the second one just to check and show a message if the user fails and the last check and show a message if the user guess. 
        * Third conditional that only makes sure the user is not cheating and ask for the right character.
        * Finally all the conditionals to print the gallow in different stages.   
### SOME of my issues 
    Dear teachers please have patience with me, here are some of the things that cost me the most:
    - Stoping the while loop, I try I swear I try but I'm not really good friend with while loops. 😤
    I tought typing hang == False would stop it but clearly it does not AND clearly I do not know why.
    - Even though I made myself a sketch I'm still a mess typing my code. 🙁
    - Last one, I'll keep trying. 💪🏽
    So feel free to tell me whatever you want about my code.
